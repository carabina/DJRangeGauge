# DJRangeGauge
Clean, simple, beautiful adjustable gauge with two needles to specify a range.

Based on SFGaugeView, but modernized, converted to Swift, made inspectable/designable, and with shaded area between the needles.

By setting specific minLevel and maxLevels, the scale can be varied.

Delegate callbacks return changes in needle level values.
